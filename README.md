#### Description:
This application allows users to create decks of flaschards and take quizzes on the decks. The initial view is a list of the user's decks. The user can navigate by clicking on a deck from the list of decks. From there, the user can choose to add a card or (if there is at least one card in the deck) start a quiz.

The quiz view shows the question first. The user can view the answer by clicking the 'Answer' button. Then, the user can self-assess by clicking either the 'correct' or 'incorrect' button. This will take them to the next question or their results, depending on whether there are any cards left in the deck. The results show the user's score as a percentage of the correctly answered flashcards.
